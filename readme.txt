A Facebook like button which you can configure to like any page on your site or a Facebook fan page.

== Description ==

Let a visitor share your pages and content with friends on Facebook with this Facebook like button Skysa App. This app displays a Facebook Like button on the Skysa bar at the bottom of your site. Set it to allow users to Like the current page on Facebook, or Like a specific URL or Facebook fan page you specify. You may also set the color scheme of the Facebook like button.

Hint: By setting your Facebook fan page as the Facebook Like button target URL, new likes increase the total fan count on your facebook fan page and the total fans on your Facebook fan page show as the total count on your Facebook like button. This functionality can be a great benefit for your brand.
